Project 1: Linear Regression Model


What I did:
We search for the line y = ax + b that fits best the data:
â€¢ we measure the distance of the points (x1, y1), . . . ,(xm, ym) from the straight line by the vertical direction (the y-direction).
we look for the line that minimizes the sum of the sum of the squares of the distances from the points (x1, y1), . . . ,(xm, ym)

Linear regression model in neural network:
In neural network, we usually have multiple non-linear regression models. 
Regression analysis help me model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
A linear model makes prediction by computing a weighted sum of the input features, plus a constant called the bias term. 

We can also have models like Polynomial Regression,Logistic Regression,Stepwise Regression, and Ridge Regression.
Neural networks can be treated as regression models. It closely resembles the logistic regression model by taking some depedent variables
as neurons.
